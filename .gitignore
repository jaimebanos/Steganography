# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install at all, so it may be a good idea to add it locally. Suggested by @mariocj89.

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/py_otherside
